MSP430 follows Von-Neumann architecture.
- All the memory and information available to the processor is available in one place.

Registers:
- A register is a very small amount of very fast memory that is built into the CPU in order to speed up its operations by providing quick access to commonly used values. 
- Collection of addresses.
- Controls the function of various parts of the processor and its peripherals.
- Grouped into three sections:
	- Special Function Registers
	- 8 bit peripherals (parts that need only 8 bits to read instructions)
	- 16 bit peripherals
- Special sections of memory that configure the device and tell us when something important happens.

PxIN:
- Input register for a port is a read-only value. When a pin is selected to be an input, reading the value of the bits tells you the voltage currently on that pin. 
- As it is a digital system, there is a particular threshold built into the device such that any voltage over that value is read as 1 and any voltage read below is read as 0.

PxOUT:
- Output register for a port is writable. Like input, a 0 corresponds to voltage on Vss, and a 1 corresponds to the voltage on Vcc.

PxDIR:
- The direction register determines whether a pin is an input, or an output. You can't change a pin's behaviour in the middle of your program.

PxIE: Interrupt Enable
PxIES: Interrupt edge select
PxIFG: Interrupt flag register

Interrupt:
- Special message to CPU to hold on what it's currently doing and take care of the special circumstance. Once the interrupt has been satisfied, the CPU returns to where it was before.

PxSEL:
- Most of the port pins have multiple functions. The selection register determines what function a pin takes on. Changing the bits in PxSEL changes the behaviour of the pins.

PxREn: Resistor enable register
- It is helpful to pull the voltage up to Vcc or down to Vss, such as when you attach a push button to a pin.

-> Bit 0 of P1OUT controls P1.0, bit 1 controls P1.1 and so forth.

To make our operations easier, MSP430 header includes exact definition for bits upto 16 bits.
#define BIT0	(0x0001)
#define BIT1	(0x0002)
#define BIT2	(0x0004)
#define BIT3	(0x0008)
#define BIT4	(0x0010)
#define BIT5	(0x0020)
#define BIT6	(0x0040)
#define BIT7	(0x0080)
#define BIT8	(0x0100)
#define BIT9	(0x0200)
#define BITA	(0x0400)
#define BITB	(0x0800)
#define BITC	(0x1000)
#define BITD	(0x2000)
#define BITE	(0x4000)
#define BITF	(0x8000)

- We can use these definitions so we don't have to memorize the hexadecimal notations.
Ex. P1OUT |= BIT0
