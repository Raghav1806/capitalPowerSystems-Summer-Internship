Two types of meter testing:
(1) Acceptance Test
(2) Routine Test

Following tests are generally carried for testing Electric Meters:

(1) AC high voltage test (A,R)
Significance: Checks whether meter works perfectly when abruptly large value of voltage is supplied.

(2) Insulation test (A,R)
Significance: Checks whether meter works perfectly when large voltage is struck on its surface.

(3) Test on limits of error (A,R)
Significance: Compares the supplied (actual) value of current and voltage applied to the meter given that various combinations of load (resistive, capacitive and inducive) are applied to it.

(4) Test of Meter Constant (A)
- Meter Constant : Number of LED pulses equal to 1KWHr

(5) Test of starting condition (A,R)
Sigificance: Checks whether meter gives reading for a given minimum amount of current (0.5% of I(basic)) given that various combinations of load (resistive, capacitive and inductive) are applied to it. 

(6) Test of no-load condition (A,R)
Significance: Checks the behaviour of meter when voltage is supplied to it, but load is not applied to it.

(7) Test of repeatability of error (A)
Significance: Checks the error produced in meter readings when various combinations of load (resistive, capacitive and inducive) are applied to it.

(8) Test of power consumption (A)
Significance: Checks the power consumed by meter itself for its proper functioning.


Major terms used:
(1) Meter constant: Expresses relation between energy registered by meter and corresponding pulse count of test output.
(2) Basic current: Value of current in accordance with which the relevant performance of meter is fixed.
(3) %age error: (Energy Registered - True Energy)/True Energy

Electrical Requirements of the meter:
(1) Power Consumption
(2) Influence of supply voltage
(3) Voltage range
(4) Voltage dips and interruption
(5) Start time over current
(6) Influence of self heating
(7) Influence of heating
(8) Insulation
(9) Immunity of earth fault

Electromagnetic compatibility
(1) Immunity to electromagnetic disturbance
	- Electrostatic discharge
	- Electromagnetic High Field
	- Fast transient burst
(2) Radio interference suppression
