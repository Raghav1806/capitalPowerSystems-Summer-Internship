Microprocessor:
(1) Multitasking in nature. Can perform multiple tasks at a time. Ex. On computer we can play music while writing text in text editor.
(2) RAM, ROM, I/O ports, and Timers can be added externally and can vary in numbers.
(3) Designers can decide the number of memory or I/O ports needed.
(4) External support of external memory and I/O ports makes a microprocessor-based system heavier and costlier.
(5) External devices require more space and their power consumption is high.

Microcontroller:
(1) Single task oriented. Ex. a washing machine is designed for washing clothes only.
(2) RAM, ROM, I/O ports, and Timers cannot be added externally. These components are to be embedded together on a chip and are fixed in numbers.
(3) Fixed number of memory or I/O makes a microcontroller ideal for limited but specific task.
(4) Microcontrollers are lightweight and cheaper than a microprocessor.
(5) A microcontroller based system consumes less power and takes less space.
