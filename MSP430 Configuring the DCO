- DCO (Digitally Controlled Oscillator) is the easiest of the clock sources to configure, as it requires no external parts and is controlled completely by software.
- DCO is configured with two registers: DCOCTL and BCSCTL1.
- There are 128 distinct frequencies available to the DCO.

- We are able to select the frequency we use with the RSELx bits in BCSCTL1 (select range 0 to 15) and the DCOx bits in DCOCTL (select step 0 to 7). [use datasheet].

- Notation: DCO(r,s) - r->range, s->step

- SRSEL, SDCO give the ratio of subsequent ranges and steps.
(1) SRSEL: (r+1,s)/(r,s)
(2) SDCO: (r,s+1)/r(s)
This allows to get a value for any of the possible combinations.
