Declarations:
	- const: Value should not be modified.
	- volatile: Variable may appear to change "spontaneously" with no direct action by user's program.

The peripheral registers associated with input ports must be treated as volatile in an embedded system.

Layout of assembly language:
(1) label- starts in the first column and maybe followed by a colon (:) for clarity.
(2) operation- either an instruction, which is translated into binary machine code for the processor itself, or a directive, which contrlos the assembler.
(3) operands- data needed for this operation (not always required).
(4) comment- the rest of the line, following a semicolon(;).
