PCB design in EAGLE is a two-step process. First you design your schematic, then you lay out a PCB based on that schematic. EAGLE's board and schematic editors work hand-in-hand. A well designed schematic is critical to the overall PCB design process. It helps in catching errors before the board is fabricated, and helps to debug a board when soething doesn't work. 

(1) Create a project
(2) Create a schematic
(3) Add parts to schematic using ADD tool
(4) Wire up the schematic [Use NET tool and not WIRE tool] 
(5) Use NAME, LABEL tool for naming component, etc.

Tips and Tricks:
(1) Names and values: every component on your schematic should have two editable text fields: a name and a value, using NAME and VALUE tool respectively.

(2) Verifying connections: [using SHOW tool]
