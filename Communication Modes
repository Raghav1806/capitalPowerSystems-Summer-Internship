Their are different possible communication methods through which elecreonic meters can interact whith outside world, generally UART is used in smart electrical meters.
- By default, UART is high.
C3: Used to denote 1-phase electric meter.
C2: Used to denote 3-phase electric meter.

(*) CMRI: Common Meter Reading Instrument.
(*) BCS: Base Computer Software.

(1) UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
- Computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication.
- Data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
- Acts as an intermediary between parallel and serial interfaces.
- Responsible for both sending and receiving serial data.
- Two UARTs can communicate directly with each other.
- UARTs transmit data asynchronously
	- No clock signal is required to synchronize output of bits from transmitting UART to sampling of bits by UART.
- Transmitting UART adds start and stop bits to the data packet being transferred.
- After transmitting UART gets parallel data from data bus, it adds start bit, parity bit and stop bit, creating a data packet.

(2) SPI communication: (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- Synchronous.
- MOSI: Line for master to send data to slave.
- MISO: Line for slave to send data to master.
- SCLK: Line for clock signal.
- SS/CS: (Slave Select/Chip Select): Line for master to select which slave to send data to.
- Multiple Slaves are possible in this system.

(3) I2C comunication: 
- Synchronous.
- Can connect multiple slave to a single master.
- Multiple master controlling multiple/single slave.
- SDA (Serial Data): Line for master and slave to send and receive data.
- SCL (Serial CLock): Line that carries clock signal.
(a) Start Condition
(b) Stop Condition
(c) Address frame: Address of slave
(d) Read/Write bit: Whether master sending data or vice versa
(e) ACK/NACK bit: Received from receiver to sender
(f) Data frame

Steps invlolved in I2C communication:
- Master sends start condition to every connected slave.
- Master sends each slave 7 or 10 bit address of slave.
- Each slave compares the address sent from master to its own address. If it matches - ACK is returned, else NACK is returned.
- Master sends or receives data frame.
- After each data frame has been transferred, receiving device returns ACK bit to sender.
- To stop data transmission, master sends stop condition to slave tag.

(*) Bit Banging: Bit banging refers to the implementation of a digital communications protocol from GPIO primi-
tives. In other words, using a predefined sequence of high and low on the GPIO, we can emulate
a protocol such as SPI. When dedicated hardware is unavailable (such as when youâ€™ve used up all
possible modules that are available), bit banging may be one of few choices left without resorting
to using a different device.
