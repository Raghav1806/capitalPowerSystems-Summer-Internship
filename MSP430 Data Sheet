- RISC Architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Computer
- A computer that has a small set of simple and general instruction, rather than a large set of complex and specialised instructions.

CPU: 
- MSP430 CPU has a 16-bit RISC architecture.
- CPU is integrated with 16 registers that provide reduced instruction execution time. The register to register operation execution time is one cycle of the CPU clock.
R0: Program counter
R1: Stack pointer
R2: Status register
R3: Constant generator
R4-R15: General Purpose registers
- Peripherals are connected to the CPU uisng data, address, and control buses, and can be handled with all instructions.

Operating Modes:
MSP430 has one active and five software selectable low-power modes of operation. An interrupt event can wake up the device from any of the low power modes, service the request, and restore back to the low-power mode on return from the interrupt program.

Basic clock module provides following clock signals:
	- Auxiliary clock, sourced either from a 32.768 KHz watch crystal or the internal LF oscillator.
	- Main clock, the system clock used by CPU
	- Sub-main clock, sub system clock used by the peripheral modules.

Brownout: 
The brownout circuit is implemented to provide the proper internal reset signal to the device during power on and power off.

Watchdog timer:
The primary function of a watchdog timer module is to perform a controlled system restart after a software problem occurs. If the selected time interval expires, a system reset is generated.
