Data Exchange for Electricity Meter:
- Reading, tariff and load control.
- Data Concentrator: A device used for collecting data from various users and submit it to host computer.
- Host Computer: Computer system which can collect data remotely from a meter or data concentrator.
- A meter shall support minimum 2 ports for data communication:
	(a) P1 - Electrical Port
	(b) P2 - Optical Port
- The meter shall support 3 associations in the management logical device.
	(1) Public Client Association (PC)
		(a) Meters' real time clock
		(b) Meters' serial number
	(2) Meter Reader Association (MR)
		(a) Profile objects allowing bulk collection of data.
		(b) Simple objects allowing access to items in instantaneous parameter list.
	(3) Utility Settings Association (US)
		(a) All objects accessible via MR association.
		(b) Simple and compound objects allowing tarrification and configuration of meter.

- What is DLMS/COSEM
Automatic Meter Reading, or more general - Demand Side Management - needs universal definitions, needs communication standards. DLMS/COSEM is the common language so that the partners can understand each other.

- DLMS: Device Language Message Specification
	- A generalized concept for abstract modelling of communication entities.

- COSEm: COmpanion Specification for Energy Metering
	- Sets the rules, based on existing standards, for data exchange with energy meters.

- DLMS/COSEM is:
(1) An object model, to view the functionality of the meter, as it is seen at its interface(s).
(2) An identification system for all metering data.
(3) A messaging method to communicate with the model and to turn the data to a series of bytes.
(4) A transporting method to carry the information between the metering equipment and the data collection system.

- OBIS Code: OBject Identification System
Defines identification codes for all data in DLMS/COSEM compliant metering equipment. OBIS codes are meaningful combinations of values in each of the six value groups A to F in a hierarchical structure. They are used as logical names of COSEM objects and - together with class_Id and version_Id - unambiguously identify all COSEM object instances. They are also used to identify data on the display of metering equipment. 

General OBIS Code looks like: a.b.94.91.e.f
