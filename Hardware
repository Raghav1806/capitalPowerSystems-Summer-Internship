- Microcontroller used: Freescale (NXP) SC667502 GLHS IN29N [Photon DS]

- Main circuit components:
(1) DC supply
Motive: To reduce the input voltage levels and feed it into the main circuit.

(2) RTC battery [Real Time Clock]
Motive: Constant power supply to RTC terminal of microcontroller, whether meter is ON/OFF.
 
(3) Main battery 
Motive: Used as a source for various circuit components like power control, push button etc.

(4) Neutral missing
Motive: For checking Neutral Missing tampering condition.

(5) Neutral CT
Motive: To check the Neutral current in meter in case of tampering.

(6) Shunt
Motive: To check the Phase current in meter in case of tampering.

(*) Note: Total current flowing through meter = Phase current + Neutral current.

(7) Voltage network
Motive: Used to narrow down voltage and input it to the microcontroller, which is then used to output the voltage on LCD screen.

(8) Power control
Motive: To supply voltage when a switch is pressed.

(9) RS 232 communication [used less]
Motive: To transfer data using cable from meter to data accumulator. [UART]

(10) Optical + IR communication
Motive: To transfer data using optical sensors from meter to data accumulator. [UART]

(11) Magnet sensor
Motive: Used to detect high voltage application for tampering purpose.

(12) EEPROM [Memory]
Motive: Memory to store data.
EEPROM: Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory.
- Non volatile memory to store small amounts of data, allows bytes to be read, erased and re-written individually.
- Electrical Interface: [for data input and output]
	(a) Serial
	(b) Parallel
- Parallel EEPROM is faster but larger in size than serial EEPROM.
- EEPROM requires data to be written or erased one byte at a time. 

(13) Push button
Motive: Start the meter and show the values of different parameters when button is pressed.

(14) Debugger connector
Motive: Used to upload code into the meter [JTAG].

(15) Cover open switch
Motive: It checks whether the cover has been opened or not for tampering purpose.

(16) LED
Motive: LED blink rate is directly proportional to user consumption rate. 
 
(17) LCD [25 pin] 
Motive: To display various parameters of the meter.
